# Homework-2
The Second Homework for the Rice Full-Stack Coding Bootcamp

This is a fully responsive website built using bootstrap libraries for CSS and Javascript along with a bit of JQuery in the loading screens.

Each tab should be reactive and will link you to the appropriate segment of the applicaiton, with the top left logo linking you back to the homepage.

The two email forms are not yet functional to send emails, but are still able to be filled and submitted.

The links in each project have not yet been filled, therefore even if the buttons are able to be clicked, they will not link to any other site.

Site to be updated in the future.
